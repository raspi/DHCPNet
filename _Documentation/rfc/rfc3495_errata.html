<p>Section 5.5. says:
</p>
<pre class="rfctext">
   The PacketCable architecture requires an MTA to authenticate itself
   to the TSP's network via the Kerberos protocol.  A Kerberos Realm
   name is required at the MTA to permit a DNS lookup for the address of
   the TSP's Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) entity.

   The Kerberos Realm name MUST be encoded per the domain style realm
   name described in RFC 1510 [5].  This realm name MUST be all capital
   letters and conform to the syntax described in RFC 1035 [3] section
   3.1.  The sub-option is encoded as follows:

       Code   Len   Kerberos Realm Name
      +-----+-----+-----+-----+   +-----+
      |  6  |  n  |  k1 |  k2 |...|  kn |
      +-----+-----+-----+-----+   +-----+
</pre>
<p>It should say:</p>

      +-----+-----+-----+-----+   +-----+

   Where k1...kn is the &quot;DNS wire&quot; encoded realm name (see RFC 3315,
   section 8). Thus, the realm &quot;BASIC.1&quot; is encoded as
   &quot;\005BASIC\0011\000&quot;.
</pre>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p class="simpleindent">
This text is not completely clear about how the realm name is to be encoded - as a 'string' or 'fqdn'.<br />
<br />
RFC 1510 states:<br />
<br />
   Kerberos realms are encoded as GeneralStrings. Realms shall not<br />
   contain a character with the code 0 (the ASCII NUL).  Most realms<br />
   will usually consist of several components separated by periods (.),<br />
   in the style of Internet Domain Names, or separated by slashes (/) in<br />
   the style of X.500 names.<br />
<br />
And the reference to RFC 1035 section 3.1 is &quot;conform to the syntax&quot; which isn't the same as use this encoding - though I do agree that section 3.1 is mostly about &quot;DNS wire encoding&quot;. It is just the use of &quot;encoded&quot; and &quot;confirm to the syntax&quot; combination that makes this unclear.<br />
<br />
It is believed that the intended encoding is in DNS wire format. And, this should be clarified.
