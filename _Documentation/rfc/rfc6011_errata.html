<p>Section 2.3.1.2 says:
</p>
<pre class="rfctext">
   If the DNS request to resolve the Configuration Service Domain name
   to a request URL does not receive any response, the UA should follow
   standard DNS retry procedures.

   If the DNS request to resolve the Configuration Service Domain name
|  to a host name returns a response that indicates that no matching
|  result is available (NXDOMAIN), the UA SHOULD attempt to obtain
   another Configuration Service Domain name using the procedures in
   Section 2.2, &quot;Obtaining the Configuration Service Domain&quot;.

</pre>
<p>It should say:</p>
<pre class="rfctext">
   If the DNS request to resolve the Configuration Service Domain name
   to a request URL does not receive any response, the UA should follow
   standard DNS retry procedures.

   If the DNS request to resolve the Configuration Service Domain name
|  to a request URL returns a response that indicates that the queried
|  domain does not exist (NXDomain), that no matching result is
|  available at that domain (NoError response with an empty NAPTR RRset
|  in the Answer section), or that a permanent error condition exists
|  (other non-zero RCODE value, e.g., ServFail), the UA SHOULD attempt
   to obtain another Configuration Service Domain name using the
   procedures in Section 2.2, &quot;Obtaining the Configuration Service
   Domain&quot;.


</pre>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p class="simpleindent">
Rationale:<br />
a) This section discusses the U-NAPTR usage; therefore, as in the first<br />
   paragraph, the second paragraph should not erroneously indicate<br />
   a &quot;host name&quot; return, it also should precisely indicate that it<br />
   talks about U-NAPTR lookup; hence   s/host name/request URL/ .<br />
<br />
b) It is an unfortunately widespread misconception that a DNS query<br />
   for a RR type that does not exists at a particular domain name<br />
   returns a NXDomain response.  This is not the case.  An empty RRset<br />
   is a valid response returned with RCODE=0 (NoError).  Further, the<br />
   RFC text omits the important error cases that also need to be dealt<br />
   with by the SIP UA configuration procedure.<br />
   The replacement text tries to clarify the different situations<br />
   where no NAPTR record can be obtained.<br />
<br />
c) Use the standard version spelling of DNS RCODE names as registered<br />
   in the &quot;DNS RCODEs&quot; sub-registry -- part of<br />
   http://www.IANA.ORG/assignments/dns-parameters.

<p>Section 2.4.2 says:
</p>
<pre class="rfctext">
[[ first bullet on page 14: ]]
 
  o  If a DNS request to resolve the host name in the request URL
      returns a response that indicates that no matching result is
|     available (NXDOMAIN), the UA MUST remove that request URL from the
      list of alternatives for the Configuration Service Domain.

<p>Notes:</p>
<p class="simpleindent">
Rationale:<br />
  See the related Errata Note for Section 2.3.1.2 (EID=2622) for<br />
  background and details. Dropping the parenthetical &quot;NXDOMAIN&quot;<br />
  here seems to be the most simple way to remove the misleading<br />
  allusion that &quot;no matching data available&quot; be equivalent to a<br />
  NXDomain response.
