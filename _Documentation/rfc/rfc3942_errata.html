<p>Section 6. IANA Cons says:
</p>
<pre class="rfctext">
   4. change the listing of any options listed as &quot;Tentatively-Assigned&quot;
|     to &quot;Unavailable&quot; 18 months from this RFC's publication date and
      periodically thereafter as long as there is an option listed as
      &quot;Tentatively-Assigned&quot;, if no un-expired Internet-Draft exists
      documenting the usage.

</pre>
<p>It should say:</p>
<pre class="rfctext">
   4. change the listing of any options listed as &quot;Tentatively-Assigned&quot;
|     to &quot;Unassigned&quot; 18 months from this RFC's publication date and
      periodically thereafter as long as there is an option listed as
      &quot;Tentatively-Assigned&quot;, if no un-expired Internet-Draft exists
      documenting the usage.

</pre>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p class="simpleindent">
The body of the RFC clearly states in Section 4, bullet 4.<br />
that the IANA action desired by the RFC is to make these code<br />
points available for assignment after the 18-month grace period.<br />
<br />
This Errata Note is tagged as &quot;Technical&quot; because the inconsistency<br />
between the IANA Considerations and the body of the RFC apparently<br />
has caused IANA to not follow the body and spirit of the RFC -- at<br />
the time this Errata Note is being filed, there are several entries<br />
left in the BOOTP+DHCP parameters option codes registry that should<br />
have been cleaned up and made available for assignment since the<br />
publication of RFC 3942 in November 2004.
