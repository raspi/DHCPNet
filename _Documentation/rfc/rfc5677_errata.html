<p>Notes:</p>
<p class="simpleindent">
Rationale:<br />
  The published RFC uses improved terminology, distinguishing<br />
  between &quot;MoS&quot; (IEEE 802.21 Mobility Services) and &quot;Mobility <br />
  Servers&quot; providing these services -- cf. Section 2 of the RFC.<br />
  Unfortunately, this change has been missed for the heading of<br />
  Figure 9, on top of page 20.
